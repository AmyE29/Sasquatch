            <p class = about>Hello I'm Tyler  Lawson and I'm 25, When I was 18 I joined the military, spending 6 years in the Air Force doing security and law enforcement. I enjoy the process of learning new things and applying myself to be better than I was in the past. This mindset is tremendous part of who I am as a person. Becoming a Software Developer gives me an opportunity to make an impact in this world whether it's big or small.  </p>
