# Squatch-Trail

Team Sasquatch is Amy, Tyler, Leandro and Stephen.

We are making a game where you are trying to run away from Big Foot before he catches you. A series of cards will pop us asking you to chose an option, your response will generate a random value from an array that will advance your character a certain number of "feet" down the trail towards your car and safety.  Big Foot advances at a steady pace, so your choice will either push you further away from him, or bring him closer to you.  If you reach your car before Big Foot reaches you, you win.  If he reaches you first you die.

This game purely for entertainment purposes, with the hope to solve your boredom.
